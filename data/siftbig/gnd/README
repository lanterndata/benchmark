The set of files contained in this directory is the groundtruth for the ANN_SIFT1B dataset, 
which comprises
- 1 billion vector for the database into which the search is performed
- 10000 query vectors

The learning set (100 million vectors) is not used to compute this groundtruth. 
The groundtruth is provided with respect to the Euclidean distance. 

The groundtruth has been performed assuming that the set of vectors is 
- the billion-sized set for vectors
- subsets of varying sizes: from n=1M to 500M vectors. In that case, the first 
  n vectors are used as the database to be searched. 
 
For each dataset size n, we provide
1) the set of squared distances associated with the k nearest neighbors, 
   in increasing order (the first one is the first nearest neighbors).
   This file is called "dis_N.fvecs", with N the number of vectors in the subset. 
   The format is .fvecs, see the matlab file to see its structure (functions are 
   given in the yael library to read this kind of files)
2) the corresponding of indexes of the k nearest neighbors, ordered based on 
   their increasing distance. Note that the ideas starts from 0 in the dataset, 
   therefore for a set of 1 millions vectors, ids range from 0 to 999999. 
   The file is called "idx_N.ivecs", and is in the ivecs format (same as fvecs, 
   but with integer instead of floating point numbers).
